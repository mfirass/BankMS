# BankMS

This is a sample bank micro-service using SpringBoot with SOAP and REST API. </br>
The MS we have is in charge of handling the bank accounts, which are respresented by the Entity <i>"Compte"</i>. </br>
We've done that in three ways:
  </br>**Using a RestController.
  </br>**Using the JaxRS API and JaxWS API.
  </br>**Using SpringDataRest.
</br>The results has been tested with SoapUI
